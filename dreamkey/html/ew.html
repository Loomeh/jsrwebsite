Epilepsy Warning</H3>
Please read this manual in it's entirety before using this video game system
or allowing children to use it.<BR>
<BR>
A responsible adult should go through the contents of this manual with a
minor before allowing them to operate the system. Some people are susceptible
to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing
lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure
while watching certain television images, or playing certain video games.
This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy, or
has ever had an epileptic seizure. Certain conditions may induce undetected
epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of seizures or epilepsy.
If you or anyone in your family have ever had symptoms related to epilepsy
(seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult
a physician prior to playing.<BR>
<BR>
We advise that parents monitor the use of video games by their children.
If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness,
blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation,
any involuntary movement or convulsion, <B>IMMEDIATELY</B> discontinue use
and consult a physician. 
<H4>Additional Safety Tips</H4>

cable allows. We advise that you sit a minimum of 6.5 feet (a little over
two yards) away from the television screen.
