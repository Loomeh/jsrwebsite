<b>Image creation and use in Jet Grind Radio</b><p>

You can use artwork from your PC in the game too! Photos, drawings and scans of artwork can all be used. Use your favorite image editing program to create and save your art.<p>

<b>Image Format:</b><br>
All images must be JPEGs. The program supports "Baseline DCT" format of JPEG file. NOTE: if a file is saved as a "Progressive" JPEG file, you won't be able to use it.
<p>

<b>Image Size:</b><br>
Small: &nbsp;&nbsp;128 x 128 pixels<br>
Large: &nbsp;&nbsp;256 x 128 pixels<br>
Extra-Large: &nbsp;&nbsp;512 x 128 pixels<p>

You'll have to post the images to your own website. Then, using this browser, go to that URL and capture the image.<p>

<b>Capturing Images:</b><br>
When you move the cursor over an image, simultaneously press <b>X</b> and <b>A</b> buttons to save that image to your VMU.<p>

<b>Download it into the game:</b> <br>
<ol>
<li> At the <b>Garage</b>, go to <b>Graffiti</b> and <b>Select Graffiti From The List</b>.<br>
<li> Select the Size of the image you captured.<br>
<li> Select <b>DL</b> in the field of available graffiti pieces to the right. DL will only appear if you have downloaded images to use.<br>
<li> You will then be prompted to select the <b>Data Cut</b> with the <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> triggers. Data Cut prepares the image transparency. It goes from 0 (all areas completely opaque) to 15 (all areas transparent). If you want areas of your artwork to be transparent, play with the Data Cut until your artwork looks right; otherwise leave it at 0.<br>
<li> Be sure to <b>Save</b>. Your new graffiti will then be available to paint the town red!
</ol>
